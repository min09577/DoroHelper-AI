## DoroHelper Has Been Fully Upgraded to MDA

Thank you all for your continued support and companionship with DoroHelper.

During the ongoing development and maintenance process, the overall architecture of the script has become quite outdated, limiting the efficiency of future feature expansion and long-term maintenance. Therefore, based on the entirely new MaaFramework, the script has been completely rewritten. The new version is named **MDA (Maa Doro Assistant)**. With this mature and powerful community tool, future bug fixes and content updates will be more efficient and stable.

Compared to the old version, the new framework brings a series of significant improvements:

- Brand new UI design with a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing interface, natively supporting multilingual, and allowing free customization of themes, colors, and backgrounds
- Supports free adjustment of task order and provides richer detailed configuration options
- Supports running the game in the background for a more flexible experience
- Supports all resolutions, no longer limited to specific resolutions
- Supports Linux, macOS, and other operating systems, and is compatible with the aarch64 architecture
